So apparently no one in my Discord server knows how to make a config, so I have to make a 1-minute YouTube tutorial for it. Can you improve my script?

[Intro]
So you’re watching this because you clicked the Create Config tutorial… and realized you have no idea how to actually make one. Don’t worry — this takes less than a minute.

Step 1 – Create Your Config Folder

Go to the configs folder.
Right-click → New Folder → name it whatever you want your config to be.
Important: don’t open it yet.

Step 2 – Copy the Default Config

Open the default config folder.
Find config.json.
Copy it:

Windows: Ctrl + C

macOS: Cmd + C

Step 3 – Paste It

Now open the folder you just created.
Paste the file:

Windows: Ctrl + V

macOS: Cmd + V

Step 4 – Edit It

Right-click config.json →

Windows: Open with Notepad

macOS: Open with TextEdit

Find this line:

"active_config": "default.json"

Change default to the name of the config folder you just made.

Save the file. Done.

If you want every setting explained, click the Tutorial button in the app.

Minigame Setup

Now go to the Minigame tab.

You’ll see Fish Mode:

Image = image search

Pixel = pixel color detection

If You Choose Pixel Mode:

Catch a fish.

While in the minigame, press your screenshot key.

Go to https://kleki.com/

Paste the screenshot.

Right-click the bar color → hashtag → copy the hex code.

Paste it into ICF.

Repeat for arrow and fish.

If You Choose Image Mode:

Take a screenshot during the minigame.

Go to https://kleki.com/

Crop the image until only the bar is visible.

Do the same for the fish icon.
Not the fish line — the fish icon.

Save them as:

left_bar.png

right_bar.png

fish.png

And that’s it. Your config is ready.
