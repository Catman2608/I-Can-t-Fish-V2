## Things I want to add to 2.2 before release:
1. Retake screenshot every time
2. Auto detect bar areas
3. Make bar areas changer more accurate
4. Advanced tools: Add a click limit / second
5. Advanced tools: Add a catch until xx percentage
6. Add fish cache settings, and escaping the minigame requires fish position lost and bar position lost.
7. Add an eyedropper tool for color mode
