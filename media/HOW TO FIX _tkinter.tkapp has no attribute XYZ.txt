🚨 Pattern recap (super important)

Every error you’ve hit today follows one rule:

If Python says
_tkinter.tkapp has no attribute XYZ
then XYZ is missing from your App class

Not Tkinter.
Not CustomTkinter.
Just an undefined method or attribute.

Once you recognize that, these bugs take 30 seconds to fix.

🧠 One-sentence rule to remember

If your class subclasses Tk / CTk, then self is the window.

No root, no window, no mystery object.

🧠 Mental model (remember this forever)

| Thing                   | Where it runs        |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| Macro loop              | Background thread    |
| Keyboard listener       | OS thread            |
| Tkinter UI              | **Main thread only** |
| Tk updates from threads | `root.after()`       |

If you break this rule, Tk will explode — silently or loudly.
