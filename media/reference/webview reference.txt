Your friend is likely referring to **pywebview**, a popular and lightweight Python library that allows you to wrap web content (HTML, CSS, and JS) into a native desktop window. Think of it as a "lightweight Electron" for Python.

### Is it compatible?

Yes, **pywebview is cross-platform** and works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. However, since it uses the operating system's native web renderer rather than bundling its own (like Chrome), there are some platform-specific requirements:

| Platform | Native Renderer Used | Requirements |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Windows** | WebView2 (Edge/Chromium) or MSHTML | Requires `WebView2 Runtime` (standard on modern Windows) and `pythonnet`. |
| **macOS** | Cocoa / WebKit | Requires `PyObjC` (usually pre-installed with system Python). |
| **Linux** | GTK or Qt | Requires `PyGObject` (for GTK) or `PyQt` / `PySide`. |

---

### How to use it

1. **Installation**
Open your terminal and run:
```bash
pip install pywebview

```


2. **Basic Example**
This script creates a simple window that loads a website:
```python
import webview

# 1. Create a window (Title, URL or local HTML file)
window = webview.create_window('My Desktop App', 'https://www.google.com')

# 2. Start the engine
webview.start()

```


3. **Loading Local HTML**
If you want to build your own UI from scratch, you can load HTML strings directly:
```python
import webview

html = """
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head><style>body { font-family: sans-serif; text-align: center; padding: 50px; }</style></head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello from Python!</h1>
        <p>This is a native window running HTML.</p>
    </body>
</html>
"""

webview.create_window('Local App', html=html)
webview.start()

```



### Why use it?

* **Tiny Executables:** Since it doesn't bundle a whole browser, your final app size is much smaller than Electron.
* **Easy Communication:** You can call Python functions from JavaScript and vice versa.
* **Native Feel:** It uses native window frames, menus, and file dialogs.
